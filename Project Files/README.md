# 🦋 Butterfly Species Classifier Web App - Enchanted wings: marvels of butterfly species

A deep learning-based web application that classifies butterfly species from user-uploaded images using a VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network model. Built with Flask, this project demonstrates how AI can be applied to support biodiversity and species identification.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🎯 Predicts butterfly species from uploaded images
- 💡 Uses a pre-trained VGG16 model (transfer learning)
- 🧠 Classifies 75 unique butterfly classes
- 🌐 Beautiful web interface using HTML, CSS & Flask
- 🆓 Deployable on Render or Railway for free hosting
